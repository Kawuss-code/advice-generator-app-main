## About me
Hi! It's one of my first projects I hosted on GitHub. I did many small projects in my school but they are usually focused on the mechanizm not on the good looking side so I won't post it here. They are usually written in JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP and some other projects using databases like MySQL, MSSQL and PostgreSQL.

## About project
I created it using only HTML, CSS and JS with prepared JSON file. Project is supposed to be responsive. I tried to change the look on over 1440px devices too so it should look good on any type of device.

## Questions
If you have any tips let me know I would love having feedback. Things that I would appreciate the most would be any advice on responsiveness
